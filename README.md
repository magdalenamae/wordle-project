General Assembly Wordle Project 


# RULES
    You have 6 guesses to guess the correct word using the input box.
    You can guess any valid word by typing into the input box with your keyboard and pressing the submit button.
    After each guess, each letter will turn red, yellow, or grey.
       
         - RED is the right letter in right spot
         - YELLOW is the right letter in wrong spot
         - GREY is the wrong letter
           

## For example 
the word to guess is WORLD, the user inputs WORDL. The first three letters would be red as they are in the correct spot and the last two letters would be yellow as they are in the incorrect spot.  

### unresolved issues 

I had some issues with getting the logic on double letters right, im also atill finishing the styling as the page isnt pretty when shrunk or moved at all.
